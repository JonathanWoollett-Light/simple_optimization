I made this for my own usage since current existing libraries feel awkward.

### Optimizers
- [Random search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_search)
- Grid search
### Optimizers I might add
- [Bayesian optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization)
- [Simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)
